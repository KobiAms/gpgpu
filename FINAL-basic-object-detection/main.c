/*
Simple MPI+OpenMP+CUDA Integration example
Initially the array of size 4*PART is known for the process 0.
It sends the half of the array to the process 1.
Both processes start to increment members of thier members by 1 - partially with OpenMP, partially with CUDA
The results is send from the process 1 to the process 0, which perform the test to verify that the integration worked properly
